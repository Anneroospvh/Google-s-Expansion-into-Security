# Google's Expansion into Security
Empirical data of my PhD thesis 

The contents of the CSV stored in this repository were used for my PHD thesis and provides an overview of an extensive document analysis of almost 700 blogs, emails, GitHub documents, glossaries and guides, news articles, official announcements, podcasts, policy documents, presentations, press statements, product demonstrations, product descriptions, reports, technical documentation, and videos. One can scan through this overview directly in the browser and filter the sources on date of publication, author, title, item type, and website title. 

The complete thesis with all articles and references can be found by searching for "Google’s Expansion into Security - Platforms, Infrastructure, (In)visibility" by Anneroos Planqué - van Hardeveld that will be released later in 2025.
